# Welcome to this readme
"Many measures reside in here. Pass a 3D matrix, and grab a beer"

This package is a package of measures to calculate "consciousness". That is,
it will include measures that have been used in previous research to give a single
value to characterize a whole state of consciousness such as awake, anesthesia,
hallucinations, sleep, coma, etc.

To install:
pip[3] install [--user] git+https://github.com/andresni/pyconscious.git

To use:
import pyconscious

pyconscious.LZc(data, **kwargs)

---

Documentation is currently limited, including which measures are included and
exactly which parameters they take (and allowed values). Use tab-completion.
If invalid parameters are passed, you'll be notified, mostly.
