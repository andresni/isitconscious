# Welcome to the readme for pyconscious
This is a package for various measures applicable to continous data of whatever form.

As of version 0.1 (this) the package containes Lempel Ziv complexity, amplitude coalition entropy,
synchrony coalition entropy, and a measure of centrality.

No documentation exists, but download the "pyconscious" folder and import it. Then tab-completion
will show you the current options along with which parameters you need.

The measures included here have been used in previous literature to "measure" conscious state or
level in some way. As such, this package is intended as a one-stop shop for single number classification
tools. All you need is data, preprocessed or not (this package won't do that for you).

"Many measures reside in here. Pass a 3D matrix, and grab a beer"
